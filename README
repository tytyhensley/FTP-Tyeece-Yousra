This is a simple implementation of a FTP server that uses a TCP connection to send/receive files from clients. 

All required functions for this project have been implemeted such as uploading and downloading a file to/from the server, required user and password authorisation, along with systems calls (ls, pwd, and cd) for both client and server

There are four additional files used: 
users.txt -holds information about the user and there corresponding passwords
tests.txt -hold information about all our test cases and the errors that were not solved
lorem.txt -text file used to test data transfer
Makefile  -makefile for creating executable

NOTE: Server runs on port 8080 and 127.0.0.1 can be used as the IP address
